# This provides the secret key for authentication. In a production system I would probably use Google's Secret Manager
# API (https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/secretmanager.googleapis.com)... but storing the key
# in here is free and simple. The key is secret, and should never be added to source control. It is visible in the
# console (versions -> config) so this file can be rebuilt even if the key is lost.
